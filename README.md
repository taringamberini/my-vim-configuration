# my-vim-configuration

My current Vim configuration file.



## Install

Git SHOULD be installed, even if not yet configured as I would, so that the `curl` command is available in Git Bash.

At command line run:
```bash
$ curl -kLSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-vim-configuration/master/install.sh -o install.sh
$ sh install.sh
```

After succesful installation remove the installation script.
